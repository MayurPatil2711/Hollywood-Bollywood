# Hollywood-Bollywood
This was game we used to play when we were in school. 

The code randomly picks any name of the movie from the fixed list, and your task will be to predict the name of movie by guessing any letter.

If the movie contains guessed letter, it will show up on the screen and other letters will be hidden.

Try predicting the movie name in 2.5 minutes

Melodic music has also been added in the background.
